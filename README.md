## 1. Introduction
dbt (Data Build Tool) enables data analysts and engineers to transform data within their warehouse by writing modular SQL code. It handles SQL transformations, testing, and documentation all within one framework.

- **Key concepts**: models, snapshots, tests, sources, seeds, and macros.
- **Supported Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Postgres, etc.

## 2. Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- A data warehouse such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift.

### Install dbt
```bash
pip install dbt
```

To work with a specific warehouse, install the appropriate adapter. For example:
```bash
pip install dbt-snowflake
```

## 3. Project Setup
### Initialize a New dbt Project
Run the following command to create a new dbt project:
```bash
dbt init my_project
```
This will generate the project directory structure, including folders for `models/`, `snapshots/`, `tests/`, etc.

## 4. Configuration
### Configuring `dbt_project.yml`
Update the `dbt_project.yml` file with your projectâ€™s settings. Example:
```yaml
name: 'my_project'
version: '1.0'
profile: 'my_profile'
target-path: 'target'
models:
  my_project:
    materialized: table
```

### Connection Profile (`profiles.yml`)
Add your data warehouse credentials to the `profiles.yml` file. Example configuration for Snowflake:
```yaml
my_profile:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: <your_account>
      user: <your_username>
      password: <your_password>
      role: <your_role>
      database: <your_database>
      warehouse: <your_warehouse>
      schema: <your_schema>
```

## 5. Building Models
### Creating a Model
Models are SQL files that define your data transformations. Place them in the `models/` directory. Example model in `models/my_model.sql`:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('source_table') }}
WHERE event_date > '2023-01-01'
```

### Model Materialization
Set the materialization type (e.g., `table`, `view`, `incremental`) in your `dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    my_model:
      materialized: incremental
```

## 6. Running dbt
### Run Specific Models
```bash
dbt run --models my_model
```

### Run All Models
```bash
dbt run
```

### Build Models (Run, Test, Seed, Snapshot)
```bash
dbt build
```

## 7. Testing and Documentation
### Defining and Running Tests
You can define tests directly in YAML files. Example test in `models/schema.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
models:
  - name: my_model
    tests:
      - not_null
      - unique
```
Run all tests with:
```bash
dbt test
```

### Generating Documentation
Generate and serve documentation locally:
```bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

## 8. Advanced Features
### Macros
Use macros to create reusable SQL logic. Example:
```sql
{% macro current_timestamp() %}
SELECT current_timestamp()
{% endmacro %}
```

### Snapshots
Use snapshots to track changes over time for slowly changing dimensions (SCDs). Example snapshot:
```yaml
snapshot:
  my_snapshot:
    target: my_table
    unique_key: id
    updated_at: updated_at
```

## 9. Version Control & CI/CD
### Version Control with Git
Make sure your dbt project is version controlled. Include all SQL files, tests, and documentation in the repository.

### Continuous Integration
Set up CI pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate `dbt run` and `dbt test` commands.

## 10. Deployment
### dbt Cloud vs. Self-Hosted
- **dbt Cloud**: Offers a web IDE, job scheduling, and integrations with GitHub.
- **Self-Hosted**: Use tools like Airflow or Prefect to schedule dbt jobs and manage workflows.

## 11. Debugging and Monitoring
### dbt Debug
Use the following command to test the connection and validate your setup:
```bash
dbt debug
```

### Logs and Artifacts
Check logs in the `logs/` and `target/` directories for more information on failed runs or errors.
